<p>Hineini tells Yahoo&#39;s Fire Eagle service about your location via GPS or the nearest cell tower, or 
    with the address you manually type into the textbox at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>If you manually type an address, you must click the 'Update' button afterwards.  A message on the screen will tell you if Fire Eagle can't locate the address you've typed in.</p>
<p>Your update interval will automatically switch to &quot;Manually&quot; when you type text 
    into the textbox.&nbsp; Clicking &#39;Update&#39; with text in the textbox will clear 
    the textbox after a successful update.&nbsp; Clicking &#39;Update&#39; with no text in 
    the textbox will immediately start an update regardless of your Update Interval 
    setting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When you Update (manually or automatically), you&#39;re sending a location (address, cell tower, or GPS coordinates) to Fire Eagle.&nbsp; But Fire Eagle 
    might not record you as being at that exact location.&nbsp; Rather, it knows about 
    a vast and finite number of locations, and it records you as being at whichever 
    of those locations is nearest the location it received.</p>
<p>Typically, that will be a street address, or maybe just the name of a nearby city 
    or town.&nbsp; The location&#39;s name and map will appear on the screen, with the following notations:
    <ul>
    <li><b>*</b> means you gave your location</li>
    <li><b>+</b> means GPS gave your location</li>
    <li><b>~</b> means a cell tower gave your location</li>
    </ul>
    If there&#39;s a problem, you can check the Error Log for details.</p>
